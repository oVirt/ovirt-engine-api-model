     * The virtual machine is intended to be used as a high performance virtual machine.
     *
     * Currently, its implication is that the virtual machine configuration will automatically be set for running
     * with the highest possible performance, and with performance metrics as close to bare metal as possible.
     *
     * Some of the recommended configuration settings for the highest possible performance
     * cannot be set automatically; manually setting them before running the virtual machine is recommended.
     *
     * The following configuration changes are set automatically:
     *
     * - Enable headless mode.
     * - Enable serial console.
     * - Enable pass-through host CPU.
     * - Enable I/O threads.
     * - Enable I/O threads pinning and set the pinning topology.
     * - Enable the paravirtualized random number generator PCI (virtio-rng) device.
     * - Disable all USB devices.
     * - Disable the soundcard device.
     * - Disable the smartcard device.
     * - Disable the memory balloon device.
     * - Disable the watchdog device.
     * - Disable migration.
     * - Disable high availability.
     *
     * The following recommended configuration changes have to be set manually by the user:
     *
     * - Enable CPU pinning topology.
     * - Enable non-uniform memory access (NUMA) pinning topology.
     * - Enable and set huge pages configuration.
     * - Disable kernel same-page merging (KSM).
