     *
     * Port mirroring copies layer 3 network traffic on a given <<types/network,logical network>> and
     * <<types/host,host>> to a NIC on a <<types/vm,virtual machine>>. This virtual machine
     * can be used for network debugging and tuning, intrusion detection, and monitoring the behavior of other
     * virtual machines on the same host and logical network. The only
     * traffic copied is internal to one logical network on one host. There is no
     * increase in traffic on the network external to the host; however a virtual machine
     * with port mirroring enabled uses more host CPU and RAM than other virtual machines.
     *
     * Port mirroring has the following limitations:
     *
     *  - Hot plugging a NIC with a vNIC profile that has port mirroring enabled is not supported.
     *  - Port mirroring cannot be altered when the vNIC profile is attached to a virtual machine.
     *
     * Given the above limitations, it is recommended that you enable port mirroring on an additional,
     * dedicated vNIC profile.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: Enabling port mirroring reduces the privacy of other network users.
