/**
 * Represents a readonly network filters sub-collection.
 *
 * The network filter enables to filter packets send to/from the VM's nic according to defined rules.
 * For more information please refer to xref:services-network_filter[NetworkFilter] service documentation
 *
 * Network filters are supported in different versions, starting from version 3.0.
 *
 * A network filter is defined for each vnic profile.
 *
 * A vnic profile is defined for a specific network.
 *
 * A network can be assigned to several different clusters. In the future, each network will be defined in
 * cluster level.
 *
 * Currently, each network is being defined at data center level. Potential network filters for each network
 * are determined by the network's data center compatibility version V.
 * V must be >= the network filter version in order to configure this network filter for a specific network.
 * Please note, that if a network is assigned to cluster with a version supporting a network filter, the filter
 * may not be available due to the data center version being smaller then the network filter's version.
 *
 * Example of listing all of the supported network filters for a specific cluster:
