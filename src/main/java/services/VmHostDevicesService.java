     * [source]
     * ----
     * POST /ovirt-engine/api/vms/123/hostdevices
     * ----
     *
     * With request body of type xref:types-host_device[HostDevice], for example
     *
     * [source,xml]
     * ----
     * <host_device id="123" />
     * ----
     *
     * NOTE: A necessary precondition for a successful host device attachment is that the virtual machine must be pinned
     * to *exactly* one host. The device ID is then taken relative to this host.
     *
     * NOTE: Attachment of a PCI device that is part of a bigger IOMMU group will result in attachment of the remaining
     * devices from that IOMMU group as "placeholders". These devices are then identified using the `placeholder`
     * attribute of the xref:types-host_device[HostDevice] type set to `true`.
     *
     * In case you want attach a device that already serves as an IOMMU placeholder, simply issue an explicit Add operation
     * for it, and its `placeholder` flag will be cleared, and the device will be accessible to the virtual machine.
